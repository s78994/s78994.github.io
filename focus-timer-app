# 🦊 Focus Companion

A cozy, "Lofi" inspired Pomodoro timer and task manager designed to help students and professionals maintain deep focus. This is a single-file web application that combines productivity logic with a reactive virtual pet.

## ✨ Features

### ⏲️ Smart Pomodoro Timer
* **25-Minute Cycle**: Optimized for the Pomodoro Technique to balance work and rest.
* **Reactive States**: The UI and pet companion react to the timer status (Start, Pause, Reset).
* **Browser Integration**: The document title updates in real-time so you can monitor your time while in other tabs.
* **Audio Alerts**: Plays a soft notification chime when your focus session is complete.

### 🐱 Virtual Study Buddy
The central pet companion acts as a visual indicator of your current state:
* **Sleeping (😴)**: The app is idle and waiting for you to start.
* **Focused (😎)**: The pet is "in the zone" with a subtle pulse animation while the timer runs.
* **Thinking (🤔)**: Appears when you pause the session.
* **Happy (🥳)**: Celebrates your successful focus session when the timer hits zero.

### 📝 Persistent To-Do List
* **Task Management**: Add tasks, toggle completion with a strike-through effect, and clear the list when finished.
* **LocalStorage Persistence**: Your tasks are saved locally in your browser, so they remain available even after a page refresh or browser restart.

### 🎨 Design & Aesthetic
* **Lofi Aesthetic**: Features a soothing pastel color palette to reduce eye strain.
* **Minimalist UI**: Clean, distraction-free interface focused entirely on the task at hand.
* **Responsive**: Centered layout that works across various screen sizes.
